            <h1 className='text-3xl text-left'>How to Manage Local State in React</h1>
            <h3 className='text-2xl text-left mt-5'>Local state is perhaps the easiest kind of state to manage in React, considering there are so many tools built into the core React library for managing it.</h3>
            <h1 className='text-3xl text-left mt-5'>How to Manage Global State in React</h1>
            <h3 className='text-2xl text-left mt-5'>To manage it, however, you should opt for a third-party solution. Many developers are inclined to use built-in React features like the Context API to manage their state.</h3>

            <h1 className='text-3xl text-left mt-5'>How to Manage Server State in React</h1>
            <h3 className='text-2xl text-left mt-5'>Server state can be deceptively challenging to manage.
            At first, it seems you just need to fetch data and display it in the page. But then you need to display a loading spinner while you are waiting for the data. Then you need to handle errors and display them to the user as they arise.
            What happens when there is a network error? Do I really need to hit my server every time my user visits the home page if the data hasnâ€™t changed? Do I need to add useState and useEffect in every component I want to fetch my data?
            To fix this, there are a couple of great libraries that make data fetching in React a breeze: SWR and React Query.</h3>

            <h1 className='text-3xl text-left mt-5'>How to Manage URL State in React</h1>
            <h3 className='text-2xl text-left mt-5'>To end a difficult topic on a positive note, URL state is largely already managed for you if you are using a framework like Next.js or the current version of React Router.
            URL state is quite easy to manage, usually through custom hooks that give us all the information we need about our location, history, and pathname.
            If you are using React Router, you can get all the information you need using useHistory or useLocation.</h3>
